# screeps-haskell

This shall become a starting point for creating an AI for [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) in Haskell. I'm currently working on creating bindings JS bindings with GHCJS to get some basic examples working.

When I have to run `stack setup` on this project it takes over an hour to build everything. I uploaded a very clunky [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tourn/screeps/) that has the dependencies already built.
